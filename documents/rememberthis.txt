When the arm is pointing away from the glass there may be some weird behaviors.
The friction is position dependent
There is 2 sensors for the angle of the pendulum arm. There are some offsets and scallings that needs to be considered. This can be found in the matlab model
There are also velocity outputs for all angles (calculated internally, maybe at a higher sample rate. We don't know how good)
